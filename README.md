## Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kyrylo, im developer from 2012.

### Now I search a new work, because on the previous work project was stopped. 

So, now I`m free and can start any time.

More time I build projects on **Django framework + DRF**, but it is not all of I know. 
I have experience with the **FastApi** and the **Flask** to. 

Sometimes I deploy project on the server, then I use **Docker and Nginx**. 
Some projects need Web Scrapers, so My expertise include 
**Selenium with addons, AIOHTTP, Request**.

My [experience before developer](https://720p.com.ua), the push on me the learn **Vue.js**, 
because I was needed [site](https://fotka.kiev.ua).<br> 
_Then I create private site as [CV](https://cv.fotka.kiev.ua) to the describe My experience and public my projects._
